 Project Overview  
This project analyzes sales data to provide actionable insights for business decision-making. It identifies sales trends, top-performing products, and regional performance while automating reporting and enabling strategic planning through SQL and Power BI.  

 Key Features  
- Data Cleaning and Transformation: Used SQL to query and prepare raw sales data.  
- Interactive Dashboard: Designed a Power BI dashboard for sales trends, product performance, and regional insights.  
- Predictive Analysis: Forecasted sales trends for inventory and marketing strategies.  
- Automation: Reduced manual reporting efforts and improved analysis efficiency.  

 Technologies Used  
- SQL: Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.  
- Power BI: Dashboard creation and data visualization.  

SQL Commands and Code Examples  

 Sample SQL Queries for Data Preparation  
Extracting Relevant Sales Data  
```sql  
SELECT ProductID, Region, SalesAmount, OrderDate  
FROM SalesTable  
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2023-01-01';  
```  

 Cleaning Null Values  
```sql  
UPDATE SalesTable  
SET SalesAmount = 0  
WHERE SalesAmount IS NULL;  
```  

 Aggregating Sales by Region  
```sql  
SELECT Region, SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales  
FROM SalesTable  
GROUP BY Region  
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;  
```  

 Joining Tables for Enriched Insights  
```sql  
SELECT s.ProductID, p.ProductName, s.Region, SUM(s.SalesAmount) AS TotalSales  
FROM SalesTable s  
JOIN ProductTable p  
ON s.ProductID = p.ProductID  
GROUP BY s.ProductID, p.ProductName, s.Region;  
```  

 Power BI Integration  
- Import the prepared SQL data into Power BI.  
- Use charts such as bar, line, and pie charts to visualize sales trends and product performance.  
- Configure filters for regions and date ranges to make the dashboard interactive.
